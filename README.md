FastAPI Product Management REST API

A production-ready RESTful backend service built using FastAPI, showcasing best practices in API design, data validation, and database integration.
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable, maintainable backend application with real-world CRUD operations and ORM-based persistence.

Overview

This repository implements a complete backend system that supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for product-based resources. It follows a clean architectural approach and leverages FastAPI’s performance, Pydantic’s validation, and SQLAlchemy’s ORM capabilities to deliver a robust API layer suitable for full-stack applications.
