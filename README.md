# 🚀 FastAPI Product Management REST API

A **production-ready RESTful backend service** built using **FastAPI**, showcasing best practices in API design, data validation, and database integration.  
This project demonstrates how to build a **scalable and maintainable backend application** with real-world CRUD operations and ORM-based persistence.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository implements a complete backend system that supports **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations for product-based resources.  
It follows a clean architectural approach and leverages **FastAPI’s performance**, **Pydantic’s validation**, and **SQLAlchemy’s ORM capabilities** to deliver a robust API layer suitable for full-stack applications.
